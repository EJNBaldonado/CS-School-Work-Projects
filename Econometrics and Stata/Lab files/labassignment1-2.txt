Initially, when comparing campaign expenditures to the percentage of vote received by the candidate, there is a large 
statistical significance (t-test 0.0236/0.00480 > 2) in comparing Campaign expenditures to the percentage vote, 
but there are still biases since adding variable B^2 (Expenditures as a % related to the opponent) Campaign expenditures 
becomes less significant and R-squared (correlation coefficient) increases, giving a stronger relationship. Adding another 
variable in % voted for the President, related to B^2 as Expenditures as a % related to the opponent increase, % voted for 
the president increase, we can also see statistical significance and an increased R^2. Although accounting for Opponent campaign
expenditures and the log campaign expenditures increased the significance of campaign expenditures, both variables
proved to be statistically insignificant in the t-test. In our final regression model, the equation would be:
% Vote for candidate(hat) = Constant (B0)(hat) + (B1 = 0.473)Expenditures % related to Opponent(hat) + (B2 = 0.164)% voted for President campaign(hat)
In this model we find that campaign expenditures (in terms of increasing value in 1000s) have LITTLE influence in the outcome of an election, but the 
% of campaign expenditures related to the opponent has a larger influence on % votes for a candidate. In our error term, the model contains
omitted variable biases in the differences on the campaign expenditures of both candidate and opponent (in the 1000s) and other possible variables not included
in the dataset.
2) The estimate of B1 is biased away from zero, this is because the estimated B1 (if we were to keep Campaign expenditures) would be positive, and the bias
introducing Expenditures % related to opponent would also be positive. Given both are in the same direction, estimated B1 would be an upper bound, and true
B1 would be closer to 0.
